Heyya comrade. If you follow me you'll certainly know that I'm totally a libertarian buddy, who loves freedom and equality.
I partecipated to the FridaysForFuture parade in Bologna and brought my political beliefs there. Although the parade was meant to be apolitic, I think we'll never have a green world and society with capitalism, so I think that socialism is needed to have a green world.
So green means socialism and socialism means green tbh.

Loads of people loved the banner with written "Brucia il padrone non il carbone" that I made. It means "Burn the master not coal", but to keep the rhyme I would say "Burn the master before the disaster". I made photos with many activists and was interviewed by some students there and it was an amazing feeling of brotherhood and freedom for anyboby who was there, both the young and the olders.

Here a pic of me and my friend with our banner:

This is all! Have a nice day comrade!
