In this blog post I just wanna talk a little on the concept of convulution as it very important in Physics and in Machine Learning. Let's see a simple example of a convolution: the Dirichlet convolution.

Let's first define a arithmetical function, \(f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{C}\) is arithmetical. Note here with \(\mathbb{N}\) we mean the positive integers, without zero.
Now we can define the Dirichlet series series generated by \(f\) as $$\mathcal{D}[f](s) := \displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{f(n)}{n^s}$$

the Dirichlet series is a function of a complex number \(s\), for the ones who know about Fourier transforms, might notice the same complex argument \(s\) showing up.

Now let's define a Dirichlet convolution as $$ (f \star g)(n) := \displaystyle \sum_{d | n} f(d)g(n/d) $$
we are summing on all \(d\) that divide \(n\), we can now prove that a convolution theorem is true on this convolution we defined.

The theoream says:
$$ \mathcal{D}[f \star g](s) = \mathcal{D}[f](s) \mathcal{D}[g](s) $$

In the next blog post we'll see more about convolutions and how important they are in signal theory.
